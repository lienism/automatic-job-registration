    "Description": "This bug was reported directly from user coderanon. Thanks for finding it.\n-------\nHello, first off I really want to thank you for writing this TaskScheduler library for .NET.  It's been a huge help in my project.  I have tracked down a minor bug, though.  I've never reported a bug to an open source project before, so I apologize if I'm not doing this through the appropriate channels.  The use case is modifying and saving an existing scheduled task.\n \nExample (hope the formatting comes out right):\n \nTaskService taskServ = new TaskService();\nTask task = taskServ.RootFolder.Tasks[\"MyTask\"];\nTaskDefinition taskDef = task.Definition;\ntaskDef.Settings.Enabled = false;\ntaskServ.RootFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(task.Name, taskDef); //NullReferenceException\n \nI've narrowed down the offending line of code to V1Save(string), near the bottom of Task.cs:\n \ninternal void V1Save(string newName)\n{\nif (v1Task != null)\n{\nthis.triggers.Bind(); //should be this.Triggers.Bind() - 'Triggers' with a capital T\n \nI've come up with the following workaround:\n \nTaskService taskServ = new TaskService();\nTask task = taskServ.RootFolder.Tasks[\"MyTask\"];\nTaskDefinition taskDef = task.Definition;\ntaskDef.Settings.Enabled = false;\nTriggerCollection dummyVar = taskDef.Triggers;  //explicitly calls property to prevent an exception\ntaskServ.RootFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(task.Name, taskDef);\n \nJust thought I'd bring this to your attention, you don't need to reply to this email.  Thanks again.",
