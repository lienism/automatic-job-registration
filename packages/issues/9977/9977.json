This sources has 2 methods called \"TheProblem\" contains the code with problem and \"TheByPass\" contains my bypass. They are called in Main method wich build the task definition.\nIn Windows XP, you can see 2 triggers, first demonstrate my problem and second to demonstrate my temporary solution.\n \nthank you.",
