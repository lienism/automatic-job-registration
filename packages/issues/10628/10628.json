      "Message": "Great, hope you'll also take care of the Aero version inconsistency?\r\n\r\nIf I (from Nuget) install Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper UI, it will install the Aero components automatically. However, Nuget will find a newer Aero component and prompt me to update, which isn't possible, it will fail on saying it can't match any dependency to the TS Editor component.\r\n\r\nIf I , on the other and first install the latest Aero component, TSMW will fail saying \"Already referencing a newer version of 'AeroWizard'.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, a complete version mess.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest that you skip the auto build version increment \".*\" in your AssemblyInfo.cs files in all your related projects and set them manually instead? That would most likely solve these issues.\r\n\r\nThanks.\n",
