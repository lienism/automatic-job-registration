    "ClosedComment": "Microsoft has exposed the native Task Scheduler via COM interfaces and this library simply wraps them. .NET Core 1.0 and 1.1 do not support COM interop. Microsoft has hinted that they may support it in future releases, but nothing firm has been announced. So, until Microsoft supports COM in .NET Core, this library will not support it.",
