    "Description": "Hello,\n\nI am not sure if I should be posting this under issue, but it seems right.\n\nI would like to use your wrapper for a project of mine, but something weird is happening when I try to run it. I am using the latest version (today is 2013/06/18, using the Release 1.9.4).\n\nWhen I run this piece of code:\n\n```\nusing (TaskService ts = new TaskService())\n            {\n                TimeTrigger tt = new TimeTrigger { StartBoundary = new DateTime(2013, 6, 18, 19, 35, 00) };\n                ts.AddTask(\"TaskName\",\n                   tt,\n                   new ExecAction(\"notepad.exe\", null, null));\n                \n            }\n```\nit works perfectly fine. But if I change TimeTrigger to DailyTrigger, and nothing else, I get a compile error.\n\nThe exact error message is \"Error\t1\tThe type 'System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Xml, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.\"\n\n\nPlease let me know what's the reason for this.\nI am using Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate, and I created an empty project, with one Program.cs file in whose main I call this piece of code.\n\nBest regards!",

      "Message": "Will you post the code for how you are changing the TimeTrigger to the DailyTrigger? This may be why the error is occurring. Typically, you would need to retrieve the task, remove the TimeTrigger, add the DailyTrigger and then re-register the task. Is this what you are doing?",
