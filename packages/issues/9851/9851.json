    "Description": "1. If calling the FindTask() method, I would expect it to return a collection of results that matched the specified name (or\nideally RegEx for consistency with the GetTasks() method). Instead, the\nFindTask() method returns only a single Task object.\n \n2. Also, an extra overload on the FindTask() method would be nice -- make the searchAllFolders boolean value default to true.\n \nTrevor Sullivan",
