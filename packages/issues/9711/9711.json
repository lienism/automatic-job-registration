    "Description": "I received the following exception when calling GetRunningTasks:\n \n\"The function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80071A90)\"\n \nHere is the call stack:\nat Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.V2Interop.TaskSchedulerClass.GetRunningTasks(Int32 flags)\nat Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.TaskService.GetRunningTasks(Boolean includeHidden) in TaskService.cs:line 113\n \nSection of code (line 113 is the return statement):\n```\npublic RunningTaskCollection GetRunningTasks(bool includeHidden)\n{\n    return v2 ? new RunningTaskCollection(this, v2TaskService.GetRunningTasks(includeHidden ? 1 : 0)) : new RunningTaskCollection(this);\n}\n```\nThe next time I called GetRunningTasks it succeeded but I'm concerned this exception is going to happen again.\n \nThanks,\nMichael DePouw",

When it happened I had the Display All Running Tasks form from the Microsoft Task Schedule MMC open and I was repeated clicking refresh.\r\n\r\nI ran the task again and didn't open the form from the MMC and it didn't happen.  This doesn't prove it was the culprit but it is a piece of evidence.",
