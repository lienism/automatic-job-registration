    "Description": "When creating a new Showing the TaskEditor with an existing TaskDefinition the \"Configure for:\" shows an empty ComboBox. \nThe TaskDefinition Settings say it is Compatible with V2_2 but the TaskServer itself (remote Win2012R2) says HighestSupportedVersion V1. This only seems to be a problem when connecting remotely. I tried the TestClient localy on the server and everything looks fine.",
