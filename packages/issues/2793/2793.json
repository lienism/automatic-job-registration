    "Description": "Code for registring a simple exec task in Root Folder with repetition values does not work under Vista Home.  The same code does work on Win2k SP4.\nThe task is registerd but the entire section of the repetition of the trigger is disabled. Begin and end times are registered correctly. \nIf attemtping to  re-read the  registered task in code, 0 appears in the interval and duration properties.\nIf changed repetition values manually in the Task Scheduler window,  the correct values *do* appear in the timespans.\nSo the problem is somewhere in the registring part of the code and only on Vista.\nNote that same code was used for both OS (2k and vista), and thus no Task Scheduler 2.0 functions were used.",
