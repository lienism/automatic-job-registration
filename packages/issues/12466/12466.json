      "Message": "Let's try this: I have uploaded a zip file with a small app that can run small code snippets against the Task Scheduler library (TestTaskLibConsole.zip). On an offending system, extract the files to a folder and then run TestTaskLibConsole.exe in the same account as your prior tests withing running the application as Administrator. Also in the zip file is a file \"testcode.cs\" that contains the snippet you have reported as failing. You can open this file from the console program or paste its contents into the console window and then click the Run button. If it fails, please send me a snapshot of the window.\r\n\r\nI have tried this snippet in the console on Win 10 (1703 & 1607) and Server 2016 (1607) without any failures. I am running in a domain account that is a member of the local machine's Administrators group. In the zip file is a \"capture.png\" image that has a clip of the output from Win 10.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will help us narrow your problem.",
