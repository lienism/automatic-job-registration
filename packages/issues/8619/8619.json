      "Message": "How are you adding the reference? I have found the most effective and simple model is to use NuGet (http://nuget.org/). Once the reference is added to TaskSchedulerEditor, it will remember it and even prompt you when there is a new release. It also makes sure the assemblies are all in a permanent location so that they work with VS2010 builds correctly. Sometimes the error you are seeing has to do with where the assembly was put initially. Try NuGet and let me konw if that fixes your issue.",
