    "Description": "Hello. Today I spent some time trying to make Visual Studio Documentation working without any success. I needed detailed description of the interfaces, so I had to reverseengineer the source code of the Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper. It would be great if the documentation in PDF or any other readable mode becomes available so other users don't have to reverseengineer the source code :)",
