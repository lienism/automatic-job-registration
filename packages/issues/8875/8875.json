    "Description": "I'm working on a project to remove tasks (so we can be sure they don't trigger during the second step), edit/copy/remove some files, and restore the task, and so I have a bit of code that looks like so:\n \nstring taskName = \"ExampleTask\";\n \nusing{TaskService ts = new TaskService())\n{\n  Task t = ts.GetTask(taskName);\n  TaskDefinition td = t.Definition;\n  ts.RootFolder.DeleteTask(taskName);\n \n... And the code goes on to do the actual work.\n \nThen later:\n \nts.RootFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(taskName, td);\n \nIs the point where the exception is thrown from IPersist in the Win32 library.  The odd part is that if I change taskName before re-registering the Task it works fine, however it breaks other applications that depend on knowing about this Task's status and is thus Not A Valid Solution.  I've tried breaking out of the first using block and instantiating a second TaskService, that doesn't change anything.  The value of td isn't null when the exception is thrown, so its not like we accidentally lost the value, if I enumerate the Tasks after deleting it, it's gone, and I have no problem creating a new Task with any other name I want aside from the one I deleted.",
