    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI've tested and packaged a product for release tomorrow that includes 2.5.26 of Task Scheduler.\n\nLoading my dev environment on a different machine this morning highlighted to me that this had been deleted from nuget with 2.5.23 as the latest stable release.\n\nHave you any details on why these versions were deleted and what if any cases I should repackage my product with this older version instead?\n\nThanks,\nColum",
