We have localized versions of the TaskEditor for languages other than English. Would it be an issue is we provide a TSMW_Resources.xlsx file based on our localized (older) version of TaskEditorResources.resx? The only issue we have right now is the fact that some translations of TimeSpan units (like the Polish \"minut\" for minutes, cannot be parsed by the TaskEditor, while it is able to parse other Polish time units like \"godzina\" for hour or hours, Bez ograniczeń or Indefinitely, dzień for day.\r\n\r\nThanks,\nAudi\r\n\r\n",
