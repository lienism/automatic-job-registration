      "Message": "I've just gone through the code and cannot find a place where there is even a memory allocation or deallocation related to that code. The particular line is even within a \"try\" clause. My only guess (and sorry to push this off but I really can't see anything that would lead to that exception) is that it has something to do with Microsoft's internal library. That particular method call (IRegisteredTask.get_Definition) is a call into one of Microsoft's COM objects. It would not be surprising given the complexity of that result (ITaskDefinition) and I could see a corner case in creating the return object. I'll leave this issue open for a few months in case you are able to narrow the problem down though.",
