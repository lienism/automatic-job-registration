    "Description": "Unless I'm missing something, I believe there is a bug in the Last Week logic. I duplicated this \"error\" on both a Windows 7 and XP machine. I haven't tested every possible month of multiple years, but if you create a monthly schedule, select September or October, select Last Week, and select days to run of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... for those two months, it sets the first run date to the last Saturday (not Friday as I understand it should). For August, it chooses the last Friday and for December it chooses Friday.\n \nAm I missing something or is this a bug?\n \nThanks!",
