    "Description": "Hi,\n\nwhen upgrading to latest version, I found out that the TaskScheduler library requires .NET 4.0 full instead of client profile since 2.5.6:\n- 2.5.5 works well with client profile\n- 2.5.6 requires System.Design assembly, and thus, requires the full profile.\nCurrently, I am stuck with 2.5.5 since my application is currently working with .NET 4.0 client profile (and widely deployed).\nIt this reference necessary?",
