    "Description": "I wrote an c# console app which calls web service.\nI needed to run this app for every night, so I decided to use this task scheduler as it seems a good one to do my job.\n\nBut I got an issue which says \"Unhandled Exception: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. ...\"\nI read many articles described about same issue, but nothing is helpful.\n\nFor example,\n\n```\n                TaskDefinition td = ts.NewTask();\n                td.RegistrationInfo.Description = \"Does something\";\n                td.Principal.Id = \"any string\";\n                td.Principal.GroupId = \"NETWORK SERVICE\";\n                td.Principal.RunLevel = TaskRunLevel.LUA;\n                td.Principal.LogonType = TaskLogonType.S4U;\n                ts.RootFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(@\"NetsuiteInvoiceGetTask\", td);\n```\n\nMy OS is Windows7 64bit.\nCan anyone help me? Thanks.",

      "Message": "At what line are you getting the exception? Some other things: RunLevel defaults to LUA. TaskLogonType.S4U is reserved for user accounts. I, personally, would eliminate the GroupID, RunLevel and LogonType lines from your code and just call the RegisterTaskDefinition as outlined [here](https://taskscheduler.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=TaskSecurity&referringTitle=Documentation#system).",
