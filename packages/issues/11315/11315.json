Please copy the information below and provide it to your system administrator\nbut there is no information below to submit to the system administrator.  \n\nIt fails at this line in the code\n\nTaskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(\"Scheduled_Task\", DownloadTaskDefinition, TaskCreation.Update, <Username>, <password>, TaskLogonType.Password)\n\nThere is no errors to troubleshoot except that operation failure.  Even when I debug it just stops and my web page shows that.  \n\nAny and all help is appreciated.",

Unfortunately, this is a very difficult problem to troubleshoot because, as you have noticed, there is almost no information provided by the native library. Often, when faced with this problem, I will go to the Task Scheduler application and try to duplicate the properties I'm setting in my code. On some rare occasions, that UI will provide some feedback that can help with your troubleshooting.",
