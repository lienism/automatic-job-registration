    "Description": "Envirinment: Windows 7 64-bit, TaskScheduler library release version 1.4.2\nRepro steps:\n1. Disable Task Scheduler service in Windows 7 through the registry\n2. Run test application and create TaskService service = new TaskService();\n3. Check service.Connected property is \"true\" though the service is really disabled\n4. Also probably some other properties has wrong values, eg. HighestSupportedVersion = 1.1, but v1TaskScheduler is null and v2 equals \"true\" and v2TaskService is NOT null.\nÂ \nSo I didn't find a way how to detect that the service is stopped in Windows 7.",
