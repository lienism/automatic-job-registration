    "Description": "Steps to reproduce:\n\n1) Create a new Console Application using .NET Framework 4.5.1\n2) Install TaskScheduler NuGet-package version 2.5.17 (Install-Package TaskScheduler)\n3) Add following line to Main-method:\nusing (var ts = new TaskService()) {}\n4) Build the solution. Build fails on compiler error:\nwarning MSB3274: The primary reference \"Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler, Version=2.5.17.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=0d013ddd5178a2ae, processorArchitecture=MSIL\" could not be resolved because it was built against the \".NETFramework,Version=v4.5.2\" framework. This is a higher version than the currently targeted framework \".NETFramework,Version=v4.5.1\".\nerror CS0234: The type or namespace name 'TaskScheduler' does not exist in the namespace 'Microsoft.Win32' (are you missing an assembly reference?)\n\nI suspect this is because the binaries in the NuGet-package are located under lib\\net45 (instead of lib\\net452) and NuGet determines that it's ok to use them in .NET Framework 4.5.1 project. I don't know how  (or if it's even possible) to force NuGet to use binaries targeted for framework 4.0 form example.",
