    "Description": "I'm attempting to use the TaskService library (because it offers some functionality missing in the native PoweShell cmdlets for Scheduled Jobs) to update a scheduled task with a 'Zero' timespan which should disable the 'Stop the task if it runs longer than' setting however when I call the 'RegisterChanges' method I get the following exception:\n\nException calling \"RegisterChanges\" with \"0\" argument(s): \"The name provided is not a properly formed account name.\"\n...\n+ $task.RegisterChanges()\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : SecurityException\n\nAny ideas?  Given the error message I've tried updating the scheduled task with the Library using both a local admin account and with a domain account that has local admin rights on both a Windows 7 Desktop and a Windows Server 2008 R2 system but I get the same exception in both environments for both accounts.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nRyan",
