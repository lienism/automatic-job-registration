    "Description": "Hallo,\n\nI have a little problem with TaskScheduler.dll 1.9.4 when it runs on an XP-System (SP3)\n\nI get   HighestSupportedVersion = 1.1 from the sytem and work only with the function and property of this version.\n\nI add Task\n\n```\n Dim ts As TaskService = New TaskService()\n Dim td As TaskDefinition\n\n ' ....\n ts.RootFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(taskName, td)\n\n```\nIt worked good and I found the task-file in the folder \"scheduled tasks\"\n\nBut when I try to get all tasks in a listView, I get always an execption when I read the last task Item data.\n\n```\nDim fc As Integer\n\nfc = ts.RootFolder.Tasks.Count\nFor i = 0 To fc - 1\nt = ts.RootFolder.Tasks(i)\n....\nnext\n```\n\nFor example: I get fc = 6 as tasks count.  I think that is task(0) to task(5) witch I found as scheduled task\nWith index 0 to 4 all its ok, but when I read task(5), I get an \"ArgumerntOutOfRangeException\" !??\nThe exception comes everytime on this command <t = ts.RootFolder.Tasks(i)>\n\nWhen I add an additional task, I get the task(5) !? (but the same problem then with index 6...)\n\nWhat can I do the get all scheduled task to my listview?\n\nregards\nClark",
