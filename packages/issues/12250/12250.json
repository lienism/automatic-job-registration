The option is mentioned as Universal in this documentation:\n\nhttps://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc748841.aspx\n\nThe comments at the bottom discuss how it was renamed in the UI from Univeral to Synchronize Across Time Zones.  Is this something that could be made available thru the C# API?\n\nGreat project - keep up the good work.",
