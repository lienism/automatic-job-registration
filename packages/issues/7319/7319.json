But for me it was under the following conditions: Windows 7 32 bit (it doesn't happen on 64 bit) with the host application compiled as Release (it doesn't happen in Debug). I've been able to solve this by changing the \"TaskSchedulerV2Interop.cs\" file to add \"ref\" for the parameters as follows:\r\n\r\nvoid GetRunTimes([In] ref Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.V1Interop.SystemTime pstStart, [In] ref Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.V1Interop.SystemTime pstEnd, [In, Out] ref uint pCount, [In, Out] ref IntPtr pRunTimes);\r\n\r\nBut I have to admit I don't know if that is the right way to solve it...",
