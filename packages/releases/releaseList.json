See [url:Source Code|http://taskscheduler.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets] for full details of changes.

Extract all files and then run Install_TaskScheduler.bat to integrate the help.\n*Potentially Breaking Changes*\n_There is a remote chance that some of the changes in this release may break your code. Please check if you have code that:_\n* Makes specific assumptions about the underlying Kind (Utc, Local) of DateTime values for Trigger.StartBoundary and Trigger.EndBoundary.\n* Provides username, domain and password for connecting to remote servers. You must have all three as non-null, valid strings or all null.\n* V1 only: Assumes Task.State property does not provide the dynamic state of the task\n* V1 only: Assumes Task.Enabled property does not take effect until re-registering the task.\n* (1.8.2) Task.NextRunTime. For Task Scheduler 2.0, the return value was Dec 30, 1899 if there were no future run times. For 1.0, that value would have been DateTime.MinValue. Now all versions will return DateTime.MinValue if there are no future run times. While this is different from the native 2.0 library, it was deemed more appropriate to have consistency between the two libraries and with other .NET libraries.\n* (1.8.3) A number of the properties and methods related to reading and writing Xml that once threw NotV1SupportedException will now process the Xml.",

The flags were not getting set/cleared correctly.\n* Fixed problem with V1 ExecAction not clearing changed properties\n* Fixed problems reading full values for Trigger StartBoundary and EndBoundary\n* Fixed problem with TaskPrincipal for V1 handling SYSTEM account improperly\n* Changed TaskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(string path, TaskDefinition definition) method so it pulls user and logon type info from definition instead of defaulting to current user\n* Unbound triggers now will display their string value\n* Fixed multiple problems with editor:\n** Not handling V1 vs. V2 conditions correctly\n** Not reading V1 triggers\n** Not setting/updating all triggers correctly (event, state, and logon)\n** Not hiding history for pre-Vista systems\n** Not showing monthly selections after drop-down change\n** Not updating start and end times of triggers\n** Not handling repetition duration and interval constraints for V1 triggers\n** Not updating monthly days, months, or weeks\n** Not setting editable items correctly\n** Monthly trigger dropdowns allowing invalid selections\n** Time zone settings for times not the same as native control\n** Recurance and repetition settings not captured on save\n** Version selection cannot be changed.

    "DevelopmentStatus": "Stable",
    "Description": "If you want to use the COMHandlerAction action to run code in a startable in-process library, you have to implement the ITaskHandler interface. There are some interesting tricks to making this work. This project contains a working class library that exposes a COM object which implements ITaskHandler. It contains the Interop code for the interfaces. This is a nice option as you don't need to load an executable. A few things to note:\n\n# Create your own C# Class Library project\n# Add the TaskHandlerBase.cs file from this download into the project\n# Create a new class for your new handler\n** Inherit TaskHandlerBase\n** Create a new GUID (Tools | Create GUID)\n** Add the following attributes to the class replacing the Guid attribute with the value from the prior step\n{code:c#}\n[ObjectPooling(MinPoolSize = 2, MaxPoolSize = 10, CreationTimeout = 20)]\n[Transaction(TransactionOption.Required)]\n[ComVisible(true), Guid(\"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\")]\n[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.None)]\n{code:c#}\n** Override any appropriate methods from the TaskHandlerBase class. At a minimum, you must override the Start(string data) method. See the [url:MSDN documentation for ITaskHandler|http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa381370(v=vs.85).aspx] to understand the purposes of the four overridable methods.\n** In your Properties\\AssemblyInfo.cs file, add the following code and insert your own values for ApplicationName and Description. Update the ApplicationAccessControl if desired.\n{code:c#}\n[assembly: ApplicationActivation(ActivationOption.Server)]\n[assembly: ApplicationName(\"My COM Task\")]\n[assembly: Description(\"COM Task for Sample ITaskHandler implementation.\")]\n[assembly: ApplicationAccessControl(true,\n   AccessChecksLevel = AccessChecksLevelOption.ApplicationComponent,\n   Authentication = AuthenticationOption.Packet,\n   ImpersonationLevel = ImpersonationLevelOption.Identify)]\n[assembly: SecurityRole(\"Tester\", SetEveryoneAccess = true)]\n{code:c#}\n** In the project's properties \"Application | Assembly Information\" area, select \"Make assembly COM-visible\"\n** In the project's properties \"Signing\" tab, sign the assembly with a new key file.\n** In the project's properties \"Build Events\" tab, enter the following in the \"Post-build event command line:\" box\n{{C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegSvcs.exe \"$(TargetPath)\"}}",
