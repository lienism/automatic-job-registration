There are three things needed to localize the TriggerEditDialog: You will need to add project based resources to both the TaskService and TaskEditor (under the EditorProperties folder) projects for German. You will then need to localize the TriggerEditDialog. All three resources are already localized into Italian and Chinese. Are you able to download the source code and then add those localizations?<br />\n",
