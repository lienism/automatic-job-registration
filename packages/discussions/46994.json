This is accomplished by setting the TaskDefinition.Settings.Compatibility = TaskCompatibility.V1. You can also for the TaskService into 1.0 mode at construction by calling &quot;new TaskService(null, null, null, null, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">true</span>)&quot;.</li>\r\n<li>With the latest version of the library we have added TaskEditorDialog which mimics the functionality provided by the Vista native editor for a rich editing experience and also a wizard that allows simple tasks to be created. Either can edit 1.0 or 2.x tasks.</li>\r\n</ol>",
