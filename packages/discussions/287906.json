    "Html": "<p>This is one of those scenarios where Microsoft's choice to complete change the library between those releases bites you. Windows 2003 only has the V1 library installed and therefore all access to other systems is limited to V1 tasks and security. Windows 2008, by default&nbsp;and like Win7, will use the V2 library to create tasks. One thing you can try is to use the constructor for TaskService and always force to V1. Then all tasks created should be compatible regardless of where they're accessed from. Please post back your findings.</p>",

    "Html": "<p>Thanks for the response; that is good information and makes sense.&nbsp; I created a task on the 2008 server from a C# program and forced V1.&nbsp; It was successfully accessed from the program running on the 2003 server as you predicted.&nbsp; The interesting thing is that when the job is read from the program running on Windows 7, the job's&nbsp;HighestSupportedVersion = 1.3, and when read from server 2003 that same job's&nbsp;HighestSupportedVersion is 1.1.&nbsp; Also, the program running on Windows 7 and reading jobs&nbsp;from server 2003 show HighestSupportVersion = 1.1.&nbsp; I'm not sure I understand what is going on&nbsp;with the 1.1 and 1.3 on the same job&nbsp;so if you have an explanation I would be interested to hear it.</p>\r\n<p>My plan is to simply run my monitoring program from a 2008 server.&nbsp; In my case I am reading existing jobs and not creating new ones.&nbsp; Thank you for creating this excellent code for use with Windows Task Scheduler.</p>",
