I am going to add the “exception” logic to my Agent application. The Agent will still be launched daily, but will shut itself down on holiday runs after writing a “shutdown reason” to log.\r\n I feel this approach will be much less code intensive and easier to maintain. I’m “kinda” surprised that MS didn’t think of this scenario when they were writing the Task Scheduler.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I need to provide my user with a GUI anyway allowing them to specify which days of the year are exceptions. So it should work out well.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for responding.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",
