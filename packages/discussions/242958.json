With the Service method, I've tried &quot;SERVICE&quot; and &quot;NT AUTHORITY/SERVICE&quot;\r\n as well as NullChar for ID and password.</p>\r\n<p>As a side note, on Windows 7, I was able to get the ID/password method to work only with RunLevel set to LUA. It would not work with &quot;Highest Available&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone have any ideas how to get Service and Group methods to work on Windows 7 and/or some source code that you've gotten to work?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
