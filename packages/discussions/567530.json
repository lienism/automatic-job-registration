If I call TaskService(MyRemoteComputer,MyUserAccount,MyDomain,MyPassword, false) same thing. If however I cange false to true (so force v1) it works!\r<br />\n<br />\nI can also call TaskService(MyRemoteComputer,null,null,null,true) and that works as well so it is not an issue with credentials as you can see it is successfully creating a v1 task remotely, so why will it not allow v2 given that MyRemoteComputer is WIndows 7 and I can do this via the GUI?<br />\n",

I have looked at the documentation, what reason can there possibly be to only allow legacy connection? Especially as I can remote to computer using the GUI and create tasks that send emails manually, I clearly have permission so why is your code giving me an access denied exception?<br />\n<br />\nSystems supports version 1.3 btw<br />\n",

To dynamically determine which to use I would start with V2 and then try V1 if it fails. Since XP and Server 2003 are now out of support, it is a rarer case that a system will only support V1.<br />\n",
