The example shows how to schedule an exe as the following:<br />\n<pre><code>            td.Actions.Add(new ExecAction(&quot;notepad.exe&quot;, &quot;c:\\\\test.log&quot;, null));\n</code></pre>\n\nBut can I schedule to run one of my functions in the same C# program?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\n<br />\nFeng<br />\n",
