    "Html": "<p>You found a bug in the V2 handler for triggers! In looking at the help for ITrigger.StartBoundary I found that the string format it is looking for should specify the time zone. I did not implement it. Even if you specify a time zone in your DateTime value, it won't get interpretted right back into the COM object. I have corrected it in the code for the next release. For now, it will always use the local time so you will have to do your own time zone conversions until I update the binary. Thanks for the find!</p>",
