It doesn't occur in newer versions of our software.</p>\r\n<p>The TaskEditDialog with the General tab active is shown with the following&nbsp;settings:</p>\r\n<p>o Trigger is based on time schedule (specific date and time), ran once only.</p>\r\n<p>o Run whether user is logged on or not is checked.</p>\r\n<p>o Do not store password is checked.</p>\r\n<p>o All other settings are default settings.</p>\r\n<p>I'll take a look at some validation code for the &quot;Run with highest privileges&quot; option when the OK button in the TaskEditDialog is clicked.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, Audi</p>\r\n",
