It is currently often the case that the client (on which the application, and the library are located) has Windows XP while the remote server has Windows Server 2008.</p>\r\n<p>After a rather quick look at the code, I believe that at the instantiation of TaskService in such a situation, TaskService forces V1 mode - because it is the only one available on Windows XP, and TaskService makes a check against the local machine's OS version,\r\n even though the remote server has version 2 of TaskScheduler.</p>\r\n<p>Would it be possible to fix that, and launch the TaskService in V2 mode if it is supported by the server, regardless of the client Windows version?</p>\r\n",

The V2 COM library is not configured for remote&nbsp;instantiation so that is not even possible. We are limited by Microsoft's design.</p>\r\n<p>You could create a web service that runs on&nbsp;Windows Server 2008 that could use the TSMW to call the local V2 COM object and convey the results back to the XP client.</p>\r\n",
