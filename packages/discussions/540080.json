One thing you can do now with the 2.1.1 library is set the AllowReadOnlyTasks property to true on the TaskService instance. This should then allow you to get tasks from upstream servers that are &quot;stripped&quot; of any settings that cannot be read by the downstream system. Note however, that if a task's ReadOnly property is set, then you cannot edit it at all.<br />\n",
