If you didn't get any errors, the task may have been created and is just not visible. Under XP, you can open a Command Prompt, go to the \\Windows\\System32\\Tasks folder and look to see if the \"Test\" file exists when you do \"dir /ah\" to view hidden files.</p>",

It's not set right. if the same code is excuted under win 7 it will be triggered at start-up and then repeated every 20 min. In XP, it only starts up and it doesn't repeat. I am not sure if this option is supported under xp, but not sure.</p>",
