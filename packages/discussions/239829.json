However, when I use the statement,</p>\r\n<p>TaskService ts = new TaskService(&quot;Win7Host&quot;, null,null,null, true);</p>\r\n<p>It reports the exception, 'The network path was not dound (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070035)'</p>\r\n<p>The most werid thing is it's all OK for connection from Win 7 to Win server 2003 or for the connection just between two win 7 machines or two Win NT machines. The exception just happens for the connection from Win Server 2003 to Win 7.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Could anyone help me solve this problem. Many thanks.</p>\r\n",
