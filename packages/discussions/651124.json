Just like Windows Task Scheduler does.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhile I check with WTS, it shows me a certain list of Event Logs, which does not include &quot;Debug &amp; Analytic Logs&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nHowever, when I try to get the list of logs using EventLogSession class, I get the complete list which include those &quot;Debug &amp; Event Logs&quot; as well.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs a result, when the wrapper tries to create the task with such a trigger, it fails.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhile its not directly something wrong with the Wrapper, I still feel I am missing some link here.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo we have something in the wrapper that can be used to get the list of the Event Logs registered on the system.\r<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks In Advance\r<br />\nAshutosh<br />\n",
