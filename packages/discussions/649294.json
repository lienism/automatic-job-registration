For some reason, the native Microsoft 2.0 library will strip out the CR value from the string after registering a RegistrationInfo.Description or a RegistrationInfo.Documentation value with a CRLF value in it. The native windows multi-line textbox, expects a CRLF to display multiple lines. I have added code to correct for the native error for those two items and it will appear in the next release.<br />\n",
