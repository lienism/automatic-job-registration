All driven by a TimeSpan extension supporting Parse and ToString with formatting.</li>\r\n<li><strong>DropDownCheckList</strong> - Allows for the selection of enumerated and integer values from a drop down and will update the text accordingly.</li>\r\n<li><strong>ObjectPicker</strong> - A dialog that internally calls the DsObjectPicker COM object to display the selection dialog for users and groups.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I tried to keep the files simple so others could more easily reuse the controls. Enjoy!</p>",
