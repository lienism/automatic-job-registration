I created one Local User and logged in with that user. Using this user account I was not able to go to the Scheduled Tasks directory. When I tried to create a task through code, I received 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED) exception code. So I just wanna block such users from creating tasks.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

By default, when creating a scheduled task, you cannot enter a user who belongs to a group that has more rights than the group you belong to. For example, if you are a member of the Backup Operators group on the local computer, you cannot specify a member of the Administrators group when creating a scheduled task.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>You should be able to check to see if the current user is a member of those groups to determine access.</p>",

(But task was running properly at expected next run time.)</p>\r\n<p>I think this is a bug in Windows Task Scheduler 2.0 and it is using only first trigger from the list to calculate next run time. Do you have any idea?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
