It has been running successfully untilrecently. I have been compiling this dll, and strong typing it (requirement for SSIS). It is pulling task schedule information from multiple OS's. The task it is failing on, is on a Windows 2003 SP2 server. The job is disabled. Please let me know if I need to use a specific version or not. Thank you again for a great component.</p>\r\n<p>I&nbsp;have tested this problem in version 41280 and ran into the same issue.</p>",

Make sure that for each new server, if not running locally, you are instantiating a new TaskService class with the server's name and user credentials that have the right to view tasks. For that version of server, the Task.Enabled property should be calling V1Interop.ITask.GetFlags method and looking for the disabled flag.</p>",
