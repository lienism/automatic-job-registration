When my code died I tried building a vanilla version of this project but it gets the same error. Every time i run\r\n a task using it i get the following:</p>\r\n<p>&quot;Task Scheduler failed to launch action &quot;&quot; in instance &quot;{2ae5c073-90cc-4838-ba87-11c85394f258}&quot; of task &quot;\\MyComTestTask 01&quot;. Additional Data: Error Value: 2147746132.&quot;</p>\r\n<p>That equates to error 0x80040154, which seems to correspond to some kind of COM lookup error. However i've verified that the TaskHandler Guids are in the registry so i'm not sure what kind of problem it could actually be. Does it work properly for you under\r\n Win7 x64? If so could you possibly share the registry keys you have for MyCOMTask?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n",
