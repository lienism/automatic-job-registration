Is this by design?\r\n ...meaning it defaults to whatever is your current OS.</p>\r\n<p>(2) Can we add&nbsp;Windows 8 to the list...together with &#65279;&#65279;Windows 7,&nbsp;Vista, and&nbsp;Windows Server 2008 in the Configure for: &lt;OS&gt; choices?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, Audi</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Once I know both those things, I will update the library.</p>",
