HOWEVER if instead they go to the Triggers tab, Edit the existing weekly trigger. Then UNCHECK Wednesday and CHECK Sunday then hit OK in the Edit Trigger window you can see in the list of Triggers that the one you just edited has BOTH Sunday and Wednesday checked instead of just Sunday. No matter what you do you can't seem to unselect the day the trigger was initialized with yet it's NOT read only because you CAN add to it. I assume this is a bug.<br />\n",
