Those one I had copied from the\r\n working schtasks.</p>\r\n<p>Is there additional rights required by this wrapper or do we need more steps to read Windows XP tasks from Windows 7 ?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry if it was already asked but I hadn't found out what I should do.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance for any hint.</p>\r\n<p>guillaume666</p>\r\n",
