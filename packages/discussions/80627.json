I and some others have put a lot of time into fixing problems and adding enhancements.

Writing native scripts to build schedule tasks is beyond my abilites so the wrapper helps. I'm having a little trouble with a couple of triggers, right now, but I feel I'll get them working in time. I have several small projects that run timers while minimized to a notifyIcon. Once I get the wrapper figured out I can simplify these projects. David has done some nice work here and his efforts are appreciated.</p>",
