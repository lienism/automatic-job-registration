When I have tried to Register the Task using the UserAccountDomain and UserName properties from the Task Service which is previously instantiated with a Machine, Domain, UserName and Password, I saw that both properties are holding null value.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhereas, the deprecated properties ConnectedDomain and ConnectedUser are showing the values properly. Any idea?\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using version 2.3.0.22156 where the run time version in v4.0.30319.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nUBK<br />\n",

In that case, I have seen that the  ConnectedDomain and ConnectedUser are showing the values for the other credential that I am using. UserName property is also showing up and it is same as ConnectedUser but UserDomain is still NULL. What I need to do to have it populated?\r<br />\n<br />\nFor now I am using ConnectedDomain and ConnectedUser properties but I am looking for a better option since those properties are marked as deprecated.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nUBK<br />\n",
