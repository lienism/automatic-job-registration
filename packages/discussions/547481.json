    "Html": "A few months ago, I implemented some code that uses Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper (release 2.2.0) to trigger Task Scheduler tasks on a remote computer.  It's worked fine since then until yesterday when the remote computer was replaced with a server that has a different operating server.<br />\n<br />\nNow, I am running in to the &quot;The request is not supported 0x80070032&quot; error and haven't been able to figure out how to fix it.<br />\n<br />\nHere are the specifics:<br />\n<br />\nThe old target server was running Windows Server 2008 R2.<br />\nThe new target server is running Windows Server 2012 R2.<br />\n<br />\nThe pertinent code is very simple and is as follows:<br />\n<pre><code>using (Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.TaskService ts = new TaskService(serverName, userName, domain, password))\n            {\n                Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.Task task = ts.FindTask(&quot;TrxImporter&quot;);\n                TaskState state = TaskState.Unknown;\n                if (task != null)\n                {\n                    state = task.State;\n                    isReady = state == TaskState.Ready;\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    WriteErrorToEventLog(&quot;Task not found&quot;, &quot;TaskIsReady&quot;);\n                    return isReady;\n                }</code></pre>\n\nThe exception is thrown when the TaskService is instantiated in the using line.<br />\n<br />\nOne other piece of info: When I run this code on my dev box (Windows 7) the code works fine.  When I run it on the production box (Windows Server 2008 R2) the error occurs.<br />\n<br />\nSo just to be clear:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>When the target server was Windows Server 2008 R2, the code worked on both the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 boxes.</li>\n<li>\nNow that the target server is Windows Server 2008 R2, the code still works on Windows 7 but not on Windows Server 2008 R2.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nAlso, searching this site, I did find <a href=\"https://taskscheduler.codeplex.com/discussions/276408\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> thread about the same error (although slightly different situation) but unfortunately neither of the fixes suggested (forceV1 = true, Firewall settings) has resolve the issue for me.<br />\n<br />\nAny help is appreciated.<br />\n",

I would think if the target computer wasn't configured correctly, it wouldn't matter what the calling computer was.<br />\n<br />\nI'll check to make sure that the target computer is set up correctly, though, just in case.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: I stand corrected.  Based on that article, the calling computer's OS does matter.  OK.  I'll look in to it.<br />\n<br />\nThanks again.<br />\n",
