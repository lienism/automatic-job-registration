I am specifically looking for a daily trigger within which I can specify week days, since my application interface allows user to create a weekly schedule\r\n for days as they desire as well as daily schedule for weekdays only, and in the background for daily schedule with weekdays I create a weekly trigger so as for weekly schedule. Now the problem is that when I go for reading the task created via my application\r\n interface so I would not be able to read it correctly since both schedule will create same type of trigger, so there is no way I can differentiate in between them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is why I specifically need to create a daily trigger with weekdays set, and I thought this is possible because using windows task scheduler it gives you option to set a daily trigger with weekdays set.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Regards</p>\r\n",
