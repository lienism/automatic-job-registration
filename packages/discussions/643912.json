(GetTask method returns null, so no update happened)<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nI think this is a security related issue... I CANNOT change the SYSTEM account to some other account for the TaskA. Is there any way that ConsoleApp should be run under the context of Windows Task Scheduler to make update happen?<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n",
