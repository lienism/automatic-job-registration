I know this cannot be true as when I look at the event history in Task Scheduler, there are all kinds of rows there.  I also tried using CorrelatedTaskEventLog, but when I tried enumerating the results from that, it timed out.  Is this simply a permissions thing?  I don't see why though as the user I'm logging in with has administrator rights.  Thanks in advance for any assistance anyone can provide.<br />\n",
