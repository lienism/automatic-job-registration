How can I get that information using this library?<br />\nI tried using &quot;LastTaskResult&quot; property of &quot;Task&quot; class but it is returning different integer values from which I am not able to figure the last run result of tasks.<br />\nPlease respond to this thread.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance.<br />\n",

However, depending on how your task reports its result, this may not give an answer either.<br />\n",
