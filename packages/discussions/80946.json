    "Html": "<p>Given what you've provided, my only guess is that it has to do with the permissions of the interactive user on the remote system. It may also have something to do with timing. I have seen on rare occasions where a task that begins immediately after login gets started before the UI can handle it. You may want to try adding a small delay to the trigger and see if that helps.</p>\r\n<p>Can you provide more information on anything common between those systems where it works and where it doesn't work? If there is more detail on the problem, I may be able to help formulate some other possible solutions.</p>",
