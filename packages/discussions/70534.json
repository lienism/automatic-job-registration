An updated Program.cs in the TestTaskService project resolves the problems you experienced. You can find it in the source code drop <a href=\"http://taskscheduler.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/30818\">30818</a>. I had hard coded my credentials. Now it will grab the current user's so it will always work.</p>",
