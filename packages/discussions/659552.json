By using the Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper, it returns status code 0x1 in LastTaskResult property. Whereas when i checked the Task Scheduler Windows, it shows a blank value under LastRunResult column.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt doesn't happen on Windows Server 2016 due to the behavior seems different that it shows status code 0x41303 instead of a blank value.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo, is it normal to return 0x1 status for blank status as shown in Task Scheduler Window?<br />\n",
