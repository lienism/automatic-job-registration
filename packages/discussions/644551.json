I also have found some problems with TaskEditorDialog (for example, it does not seem to modify the task definition to reflect that you selected the option to delete the task immediately if the task is not scheduled to be run again!). I'm writing an application that does a fair amount of work with the task scheduler using your library, so I might be able to do some basic debugging to the UI components, if you can provide a version that I can compile using VS 2013.<br />\n",
