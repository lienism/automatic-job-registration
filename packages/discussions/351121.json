However I've now noticed that the NextRunTime returned by the library is &quot;30/12/1899 00:00:00&quot;, whereas the\r\n value shown in Task Scheduler is &quot;11/04/2012 04:30:00&quot;.&nbsp; I've included a code snippet below which pulls back the task incase I'm doing something wrong in there, although all the other task properties seem to be correct at this stage.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Task task = ts.GetTask(&quot;usertask-&quot; &#43; Environment.ExpandEnvironmentVariables(&quot;%username%&quot;));</p>\r\n<p>if (task != null)<br>\r\n{<br>\r\n&nbsp;LastRunTime = task.LastRunTime;<br>\r\n&nbsp;LastTaskResult = task.LastTaskResult;<br>\r\n&nbsp;NextRunTime = task.NextRunTime;<br>\r\n&nbsp;State = task.State.ToString();<br>\r\n}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The problem only occurs after the schedule has run - i.e. when the task is first created the DateTime is read back correctly, but after Windows has run the task and updated the task, an incorrect value is returned.</p>\r\n<p>Any help or pointers would be much appreciated - I'm coding in C# using&nbsp;Visual Studio 2010, targetting .Net 4.0 on Windows 7 x64 and&nbsp;I've downloaded the 1.8.1 release of the library.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your time,</p>\r\n<p>Peter</p>\r\n",
