I started getting customers contacting me saying that after Windows 10 Creators update their scheduled tasks stopped running.  The solution seemed to be to edit the task directly and change the &quot;Configure for&quot; option to say &quot;Windows 10&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nFirstly I wonder why when you create a new task it does not default to Windows 10 but says &quot;Windows Vista Windows Server 2008&quot;.  What does the option mean anyway?\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried the latest version of this library but it is still the same.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs anyone else having this problem and is there a way to make it default to Windows 10?<br />\n",

In your case, my guess is that your task has only a few, older options, so it can be supported on Windows Vista and later regardless of which OS is used to create the task.<br />\n",
