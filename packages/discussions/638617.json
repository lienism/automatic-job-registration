When I close the connection to the server, do not log off, the task is not runned any more. No error message, nothing. But it simply does not run. \r<br />\n<br />\nCan there be a reason for this behaviour?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I stay connected to the server it will keep continue to run. \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance\r<br />\n<br />\nWijnand Beke\r<br />\nThe Netherlands<br />\n",

    "Html": "I guess my first question is why even use tasks? You are effectively just launching a process immediately either using a trigger or forcing the Run of the task. Seems like you are adding complexity where none is needed. If your code doesn't fully represent what you're trying to accomplish, I would offer two suggestions: 1) The TimeTrigger will only run once and you are telling it to run Now, which by the time the task is registered is a time in the past. 2) You are immediately deleting the task so if it had not run already, it won't have a chance to run. You may also consider setting the <code>td.Settings.DeleteExpiredTaskAfter</code> to something like 5 seconds so the task will run once and then delete itself.<br />\n",
