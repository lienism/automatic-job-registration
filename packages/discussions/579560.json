    "Html": "I've played some with Quartz.Net and so I am curious how you are considering bringing the two libraries together. The primary difference is that this library uses the Windows Task Scheduler engine and Quartz.Net uses its own. They effectively have the same constructs (TaskService == IScheduler, Task + Action(s) == IJob, Trigger == ITrigger, System Events == IJobListeners). Both libraries support a fluent syntax (e.g. ts.Execute(&quot;notepad.exe&quot;).Every(2).Days().Starting(&quot;12/25/2013 7:00pm&quot;).AsTask(&quot;Test&quot;); ), though implemented slightly different. Both libraries support triggering on schedules and from a Cron statement.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo given that whole diatribe, what functions of one are you wanting to work with the other?<br />\n",

I haven't really looked at the code in great detail but as the wrapper utilises similar artifacts (Jobs, Tasks, Schedules etc.) to Quartz, I wondered if it would be possible to refactor the code to replace Task Scheduler with Quartz.Net? The only driver behind this would be as an alternative to the dependency of using Task Scheduler. Don't know if it would be feasible though.<br />\n",
