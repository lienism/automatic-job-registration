    "Html": "<p>The library is just compiled .NET code referencing a COM library. I have never had anything show up in my antivirus scans on my computer using McAfee. All referenced libraries in the Editor assembly are also compiled code using no referenced work. I'm guessing it is a false detection. The ZIP file was scanned by WinZip as it was made and before I uploaded it to CodePlex. Looking at your link, it does appear that your antivirus software has problems with MSIL which is at the heart of any .NET library.</p>",
