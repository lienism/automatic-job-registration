Supplying a username and password with a machine name set to the local machine on my Vista environment fails. If I use the same username and password to connect to a remote machine, it works. For the next release, I have added a line of code to null out the machine name if it matches the local machine. This appears to be&nbsp;a Microsoft related oddity.</p>",
