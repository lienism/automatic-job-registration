In trying to troubleshoot, it will help me to know if this is a V1 vs. V2 problem or not. Also, if I understood correctly, you are getting the correct next run time value when you use the system Windows Task Scheduler tool. If that is right, what steps are you taking to connect and then discover that value?<br />\n",
