The interesting thing is that I can schedule the tasks but I can't run them, apparently I have some security issues.\r<br />\n<br />\nI read <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/voy/archive/2007/02/23/services-isolation-in-session-0-of-windows-vista-and-longhorn-server.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>  and I think that I can't make it work. When I debug the application I don't get any errors but when I check the SecurityDescriptor for the found task (Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.Task) it says that I am missing some privileges.\r<br />\n<br />\nCould someone tell me if what I try to achieve is possible and, if it is, how? How should I configure it, or what should I use to make it work?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
