    "Html": "After some tests, I've found that creating a scedule in Windows Vista+ when the system language has interesting calendars, it fails with a COM Exception refering to StartBoundary with a bad GregorianUS date.<br />\n<br />\nLet's say the example of having a GregorianUS date, 26/02/2013, now we change it to ArabicSA date and it will be ##/##/14## (# is a number), and then schtasks will not accept the date.<br />\n<br />\nThe text conversion of dates between calendars is different on most times, however, sould the DateTime variables values of diferent calendars change? The answer is NO. The only thing that will change is the ToString way to work and format the text of the time contained.<br />\n<br />\nSince schtasks only accepts GregorianUS dates, why not simply change the values assigned and bounded of StartBoundary and EndBoundary properties in Trigger.cs? The only thing needed is change ToString(V2BoundaryDateFormat) to ToString(V2BoundaryDateFormat, CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(&quot;en-US&quot;))<br />\n<br />\nLines to be changed are 252, 373 and 646 in the Trigger.cs file, after this everything Works OK.<br />\n<br />\nTo test the error, date time system format can be changed to Arabic, then only add a task that contains a daily schedule for example. After the changes to Trigger.cs there are no errors.<br />\n<br />\nPosted this as error, don't know if it's right...!<br />\n",
