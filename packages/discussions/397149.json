I'd like to understand, what patterns produce the antivirus-warnings to remove them. But until now I did not found any description for these &quot;KeyLogger&quot; warnings. Do you can think of any code in the library, that could\r\n be misunderstood as a KeyLogger?<br>\r\n</span></p>\r\n",

I tried an \"analysis\" to see, what the antivirus software might treat as a 'risk', but this did not help me out.
