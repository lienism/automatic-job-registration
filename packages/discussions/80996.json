    "Html": "<p>I'm just guessing as I have no WHS to try this on, but I would check on run permissions. Add-ins typically run in a more secure sandbox than regular code. The Task Scheduler requires Admin privileges to run and your plug-in may not have that. I would write a really simple piece of code, maybe copying something on the project home page or in the Documentation area, to see if you can run it stand-alone on WHS. If that fails then there are different problems. If not, then you know it has something to do with the plug-in environment. Another thought is that this is a .NET 2.0 library so you plug-in will have to accommodate that version.</p>",

Beyond that, I'm not sure what to tell you other than to look on WHS forums for more info on permissions, .NET code, and plug-ins. Good luck. If you find a solution, please be sure to post it here so others don't have to go looking.</p>",
