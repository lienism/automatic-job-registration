The problem is whenever my command line arguments length exceeds 450 characters, i get a warning like this :<br />\n<pre><code>Task registered task &quot;TaskName&quot; , but not all specified triggers will start the task. User Action: Ensure all the task triggers are valid as configured. Additional Data: Error Value: 2147944183.</code></pre>\n\nAnd the task does not run eventually at the run time. Is there any limit on command line arguments' length?<br />\nBut the same thing works on windows 7 scheduler.<br />\n",
