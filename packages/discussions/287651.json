Here are the steps that cause the issue to happen:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>I run my application. My application creates (or updates) a task on startup. Initially, the application has no admin privileges. The task is created successfully. If I restart the app, the task is updated and/or deleted successfully as well.\r\n</li><li>At one point in my app, I have to get admin privileges. After granting admin privileges through UAC, I then create the task again (overwriting the previous one).\r\n</li><li>Now, if I restart my app (thus, losing admin privileges) and try to update or delete the task again, I get this error:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Access is denied. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80070005 (E_ACCESSDENIED)) at Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.V2Interop.ITaskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(String Path, ITaskDefinition pDefinition, Int32 flags, Object UserId, Object password, TaskLogonType LogonType,\r\n Object sddl) at Microsoft.Win32.TaskScheduler.TaskFolder.RegisterTaskDefinition(String Path, TaskDefinition definition, TaskCreation createType, String UserId, String password, TaskLogonType LogonType, String sddl)&nbsp;\r\n</li></ol>\r\n</li></ol>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>I resolved this for now by preventing the task from being updated or created when admin privileges (via UAC) are set, but it isn't a perfect solution. Is there another way of fixing this?</p>\r\n",
