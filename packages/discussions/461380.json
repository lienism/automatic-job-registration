My guess is that there is something peculiar about how your system is connected to your domain or workplace. Running this same code on my Windows 7 environment does not throw an exception. When you get the exception, there should be an HResult property with the result from the COM method call. If you post that value, it might help us understand why that method is failing.<br />\n",
