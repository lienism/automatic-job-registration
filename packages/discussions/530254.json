How can a previously created and registered task be deleted or unregistered from Windows Scheduler?  I wanted to offer an option to clear out their previously created task, but am having trouble figuring out how to do this.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe TaskService only appears to offer AddTask methods, but not RemoveTask.  I do see that there is a DeleteTask method in the TaskFolder class, but I'm not 100% sure how to utilize this since I was not using any particular folders when I originally implemented scheduling.<br />\n",
