What I'm really interested in is when a task changes from stopped to running and vice-versa. I'm on Windows Server 2012 with tasks that are created manually.\r<br />\n<br />\nOn Windows 2003 I subscribed to changes in the filesystem to detect any changes to tasks. This still works in 2012 EXCEPT in the case where there is a state change: no file system changes seem to happen in this case.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance!\r<br />\n<br />\nPS. Thanks for the great library, it's otherwise everything i could possibly want =)<br />\n",
