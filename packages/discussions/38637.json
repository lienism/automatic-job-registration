But when I specify the targetServer parameter to a Win2003 server, the list becomes empty.<br>\r\nThe problem is the SetTargetComputer method of ITaskScheduler, according to the MSDN, the server name must be in UNC format, but if I set the targetServer parameter in UNC format, Win2008 fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it a good idea to add some test code to add the &quot;\\\\&quot; prefix to targetServer parameter if needed to prevent this problem.\r\n",
